# Dungeon-Explorer

<b>Game made by: Me(Gabriel Hampel Meireles)</b>
<br><b>This is a fast made Demo that i just wanted to finalize</b></br>
<br><b>Made in Unity Personal</b></br>
<br>Testing some of my knowledge in unity(I could make it better but i want to finalize at least a project and i choose it)</br>
<br>It has max of 4-5 min of gameplay and 3 enemies, 1 subboss and a boss.</br>
<br>At First is kinda hard but after you get the boss attack it is easy</br>
